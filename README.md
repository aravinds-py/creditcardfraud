## ðŸ“Š Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.
- Features are anonymized using PCA except for 'Time' and 'Amount'.
- Highly imbalanced (fraudulent transactions are only ~0.17%).

## ðŸ§  Machine Learning Techniques

The following ML models are explored:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost (optional)

Class imbalance is handled using:
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
- Random Under-sampling
